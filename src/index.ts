/**
 * Was this failure OUR OWN web service? — the other half of `internal-db-class.ts`.
 *
 * fleet #1089 pulled failures from our own Postgres out of `upstream_down` by
 * keying on the SQLSTATE inside PostgREST's four-key error envelope. That
 * covered the majority and structurally could not cover the rest: the rest
 * never reach Postgres, so they carry no SQLSTATE. What was left, measured over
 * the 24h to 2026-09-02T15:00Z (fleet #1096):
 *
 *     5  pipeworx-catalog  get_pack_tools     Pipeworx catalog error: 522 — error code: 522
 *     3  fleet             fleet_list_open …  upstream_down: Fleet task queue did not respond within 25s
 *
 * 521/522/523/526 are Cloudflare saying its edge could not reach an ORIGIN, and
 * in both of those rows the origin is ours — `gateway.pipeworx.io` for the
 * catalog pack (it self-fetches when the gateway hasn't injected a manifest),
 * our own Supabase for fleet. There is no third party anywhere in either call.
 * Same defect as #1089: our own outage filed under `upstream_down`, the one
 * class that means "the source is unreachable and there is nothing for us to
 * fix", which is why the problem-tools triage skips it.
 *
 * WHY NOT A WORDING RULE. The obvious fix is to match `fleet db error:` and
 * `Pipeworx catalog error:` in classifyToolError. Each is emitted from exactly
 * one site today, so it would work today. It would also rot the first time
 * somebody rewords a label — silently, and in the direction of hiding our own
 * outage, which is worse than the bug being fixed. Every prose rule in
 * error-class.ts has needed widening as packs invented new wording (#409/#450/
 * #584); that history is most of that file's comment budget.
 *
 * WHAT THIS KEYS ON INSTEAD: **the host the call actually reached.** A URL's
 * hostname is a fact about the call, not a guess about its prose. Two
 * consequences that a pack-level flag could not give us, and the reason the
 * flag was rejected:
 *
 *   - It describes the CALL, not the pack. `govcon-intel` fans out to our own
 *     Supabase AND to genuine third parties; `court-listener` holds our cache
 *     in Supabase and fetches courtlistener.com. An `internallyHosted: true` on
 *     either pack would relabel a real third-party outage as ours — inventing
 *     work, which is the same class of error in the opposite direction.
 *   - It covers every future internal pack for free, instead of one declared
 *     slug at a time.
 *
 * WHY IT SURVIVES A REWORD. The marker below is not matched as a literal by two
 * separate files. `markInternalOrigin()` writes it and `internalHostMetricsClass()`
 * reads it, both from the single exported `INTERNAL_ORIGIN_MARKER` constant in
 * this module — so changing the wording changes both sides in the same edit and
 * cannot desynchronise them. The pack's own label (`fleet db error:`,
 * `Pipeworx catalog error:`) is not read at all: reword it freely, the class is
 * unaffected. That is the property `stripClassPrefix` lacked when it drifted
 * from its own classifier three times and needed a CI gate to hold them
 * together.
 *
 * WHERE THE 5xx TEST LIVES. `markInternalOrigin` is called from the places that
 * hold the real `Response` — `httpError`/`httpErrorMessage` and the timeout
 * branch of `fetchWithTimeout` in `shared/src/http.ts` — so "is this an
 * availability failure" is decided from the actual status code, never re-derived
 * by scraping a number out of a sentence. A 404 from our own registry for a slug
 * that does not exist is a caller's bad argument and is deliberately NOT marked.
 */

/**
 * OUR OWN web service was unreachable — not an upstream, and never `upstream_down`.
 *
 * ONE value, not three, unlike `internal_db_*`. That split existed because a
 * slow query, an exhausted pool and an unknown SQLSTATE have different owners
 * and different fixes. Here there is only one story to tell — an origin we run
 * did not answer the edge — and one owner. A bucket with no distinct owner per
 * value is decoration; #724 is what happens when a class holds several
 * situations, and inventing sub-values ahead of a reason to act on them
 * differently is the same mistake with the sign flipped.
 *
 * METRICS ONLY, exactly like PLATFORM_KEY_ERROR_CLASS and the internal_db
 * values. `classifyToolError` still answers `upstream_down` for the retry and
 * hint paths, which only care whether retrying or a sibling tool might work —
 * and it might. Nothing a caller sees or is charged changes here.
 *
 * READ SIDE: this value is in BROKEN_TOOL_CLASSES, FAULT_CLASSES and
 * ALL_ERROR_CLASSES in `workers/registry-api/src/index.ts`. All three, or it
 * lands on no dashboard — fleet #721 is the warning, where the #719 split

 * retry loop. A property on an Error would be dropped by every one of those
